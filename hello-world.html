									<p>
										Hello, dear readers, and welcome to my humble corner of the internet! 
										I am thrilled to embark on this exciting new adventure, where I will be documenting my life, experiences, and passions through this blog. 
										This platform will serve as a canvas to paint the picture of my personal journey, and I'm delighted to have you join me every step of the way.
										While this blog will primarily serve as a reflection of my ever-evolving interests, and I can't wait to dive into a diverse array of topics,
										I will be focusing on self-improvement through tech teaching as well as blogs of my travels around the world!
									</p>
									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>Why "Whatever Whenever"?</h2>
									<p>
										When first creating this blog, I struggled what kind of content I should put on here. Should I stick to tech content as I'm a Software Engineer?
										Or would trying to be a feel good content writer be more of my vibe?
										Then I thought to myself: why not all of them? Plus more!
										Life is a kaleidoscope of colors and experiences, and I believe that curiosity should never be limited to a single path. 
										Hence, I've chosen the name "Whatever Whenever" for this blog because it represents the freedom to explore, learn, and write about anything 
										that sparks my interest. This will be a space where I can share my thoughts on a wide range of subjects, but at its core, 
										it will center around the search for my true core purpose. But as time of writing, I want to focus on three key themes: tech, self-improvement, and travel guides.</p>
									<p>
										I also wanted to start writing a blog, dedicating it to my younger self who loved writing more than anything.
										From novels, short stories, picture books, poems, and even journal entries (which I’m doing now), I used to love putting my imagination to pen and paper.
										But as I got older, which I want to say is by high school, I got caught up in my other activities and obligations that I started to write less as a hobby and more within only a classroom setting. 
										And because of the classroom’s standardized grading procedure when it comes to writing which was basically five paragraphs, three main bullet points, and a conclusion restating everything from earlier in the essay. 
										And with such a rigid way of writing, I lost a lot of my “writer’s touch” I had when I was younger. 
										I noticed losing my sense of writing freedom and complexity when I started getting into more creative and classroom writing in college when my professors and peers noticed that my writing was was extremely blocky, creating a very boring and often juvenile experience for them reading my work.
									</p>
									<p>
										So that's why I thought this would not only be a great way to share my thoughts to the world, but also give my younger self an outlet to let out his creative writing self out and practice writing!
										Hopefully by this time, let’s say next year?, I’ll look back at this blog and say, “Wow, I really stunk at writing back then huh.”

									<h2>Tech Learning: Unleashing the Power of Knowledge.</h2>
									<p>
										As for my main topics in this blog, the biggest thing right now is tech.
										In this digital era, technology, and especially software engineering from web development to machine learning has become an integral part of our lives, 
										and learning tech will not only ensure you find a good job, but also to better understand the evolving world around you.
										Whether you're an enthusiastic tech enthusiast or just starting to dip your toes into the tech waters, 
										I invite you to join me on a journey of constant learning and discovery.
										From the latest tech trends, programming tips, full-length guides to learn something to fascinating insights into cutting-edge innovations, 
										we'll embark on an adventure through the digital landscape together.
									</p>

									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>Self-Improvement: Nurturing Personal Growth</h2>
									<p>
										For me, life is a continuous journey of growth and self-discovery in constant search of our main purpose.
										We all strive to be the best versions of ourselves, whether it is through grinding LeetCode or going to the gym, and this journey of self-improvement is both challenging and rewarding.
										Together, we'll explore my experiments through mindfulness, productivity, effective goal-setting, and ways to maintain a healthy work-life balance. 
										Let's empower each other to overcome obstacles and achieve our full potential, one step at a time.
									</p>

									<hr class="major" />
									
									<h2>Travel Guides: Roaming the Globe and Embracing Culture</h2>
									<p>
										During my time abroad, whether it was taking classes in London or country hopping, 
										I learned that travel itself is the ultimate teacher, offering valuable lessons and broadening our horizons. 
										I have been blessed with the opportunity to explore various breathtaking destinations through my time abroad in the spring, with each place leaving an indelible mark on my soul. 
										Through my travel guides, I hope to share captivating stories, hidden gems, and all-in-one guides that 
										will inspire you to embark on your own adventures. Whether it's a bustling metropolis, 
										a serene mountain escape, or a tropical paradise, there's always something new and exciting to discover.
									</p>

									<h2>Documenting Life: The Power of Connection</h2>

									<p>
										I've chosen to document my life through this blog because I believe in the power of connection. 
										Sharing my experiences and thoughts with you is not only an act of self-expression but also an opportunity to build a community of like-minded individuals.
										Expect new content on a multitude of topics I write up every week or so, and for now, thinking of what my blog is going to be like this summer, 
										I want my blog to be a life story: a recollection of thoughts and events of my life that I put into my writing form so eventually me, or maybe even many others after me, 
										will also read what I have to say.
									</p>
									<p>
										And with that being said, I will also make sure to keep my blogs under at least 1000 words, 
										preferably 750 for the more “technical” blogs I eventually write. 
										No one wants to read a twenty-three page thesis just to extract a simple one-liner, 
										letting alone a random guy's rants on the internet, so keeping this short and to the point will be my priority. 
									</p>
									<p>
										Well, that should be it for my “Hello World” blog. If you made it this far, you should read my other stuff (if there is any depending how early you land on this page). I’ll be updating my blog frequently with all kinds of goodies from my professional and personal life perspectives. 

										From heartfelt narratives to practical guides on life, I hope to make this journey into the realms of self-improvement through constant software updates together both enjoyable and enlightening! Buckle up, dear readers; it's going to be an exhilarating ride!
									</p>

									<p>
										For now, <br>See you Later World!
